SETUP
====================================
Using this component is very simple. This are the minimum steps to do it (assuming you already have a working yii application and a database)

1.      Copy giiComposite and extensions directory to your application's "protected" directory.
2.      Edit your main.php file. You need to compare it to main_example.php and make sure you have the extension and the giiComposite generator path added. I tagged the portions of code you will find usef$
Try it. That's all. I told you, it is very easy to setup.
3.      If it doesn't work out of the box, contact me.
