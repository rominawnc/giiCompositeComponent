giiCompositeComponent
=====================

Official GiiComposite repository


Some ground rules and information for whoever downloads this thing: 
* 1.	There will be bugs. (and sending bug reports or bug fixes is highly recommended)
* 2.	This is a small personal project, and will be mantained mostly on my free time on weekends and after work hours. 
* 3.	I am not to be held responsible for anything that may or may not happen to you for using this extension.
* 4.	If you like it, feel free let your friends and coleagues know about it. The Yii forums are full of people asking for this feature and I feel we would all benefit from it. The more people there is using it, more chances I will continue to mantain it, and even more chances that someone will help me do it.


There, now that we had this little chat, you can have fun designing super nice tables with composite keys.
